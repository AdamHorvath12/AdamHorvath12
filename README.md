# ðŸ™Œ Hello there!

I am _Adam Horvath-Reparszky_, a proactive Machine Learning Engineer at [Lalaland](https://lalaland.ai/) in Amsterdam, who is highly motivated to acquire more real-life aspects of the field. I graduated in 2021 from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/) with a Master of Science degree in Data Science.

My goal is to utilize my knowledge of data science, machine learning and deep learning to solve emerging problems that can have a positive influence on our future. While doing so, I enjoy learning new technologies and tools, and getting to know like-minded, motivated people on the way.
